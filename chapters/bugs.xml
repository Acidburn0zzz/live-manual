<title>How to report a bug in Debian Live</title>

<para><i>"No software is perfect... we need your help!"</i></para>

<para>Debian Live is far from being perfect, but we want to make it as close as possible to perfect - with your help.</para>

<para>As such, do not hesitate to report a bug:</para> it is better to fill a report twice or even to report a potential non-bug than no bug at all.</para>

<para>However, here are some recommendations how to file good bug reports so that they are the most effective.</para>

<para>For the impatient:</para>

<ul><li>Do always reproduce with the most current version of live-helper and live-initramfs before submitting a bugreport.</li>

<li>Do always try to give as *specific* as possible information about the bug. This not just includes the version of live-helper and live-initramfs used, the distribution of the live system you are building.</li></ul>

<section>
<title>Where does the bug appear?</title>

<para>...at build time while bootstrapping?</para>

<para>live-helper first bootstraps a basic Debian system with debootstrap(8) or
cdebootstrap(1). Depending on both debootstrap/cdebootstrap and the Debian
distribution it is bootstrapping, it runs sucessful or not. If a bug appears
here, check if the error is related to a specific Debian package (most likely),
or if it is related to debootstrap/cdebootstrap itself. Running lh_bootstrap
with --debug gives you more information.</para>

<para>Also, if you are using a local mirror or any of sort of (package) proxy and
you are experiencing a problem with bootstrapping, always reproduce it first by
bootstrapping from an official Debian mirror.</para>

<para>In all cases above, these are not a bug in live-helper, but rather in Debian
itself. We can not fix this directly. Instead, report such a bug against the
failing package, or in case of a bug in the bootstrapping tool, against
debootstrap or cdebootstrap, or the (package) proxy software you are using.</para>

<para>...at build time while installing packages?</para>

<para>live-helper installs additional packages from the Debian archive. Depending
on the Debian distribution used and the daily archive state, it can fail. If a
bug appears here, check if the error is also reproducible on a normal installed
(non-live) system.</para>

<para>Also, if you are including any sort of unofficial package to your live system
and you are experiencing problems, rebuild without those before filling a bug
to make sure that they are not the cause of the failure.</para>

<para>In all cases above, these are not a bug in live-helper, but rather in Debian
again. Report it against the failing package(s).</para>

<para>...at boot time?</para>

<para>If your image does not boot, please report it to the mailing list together
with the information requested in 2. Do not forget to mention, how/when the
image failed, in qemu, vmware or real hardware. If you are using a
virtualization technology of any kind, do always run it on real hardware before
reporting a bug. Nevertheless, providing a screenshot of the failure is also
very helpful.</para>

<para>...at run time?</para>

<para>If a package was successfully installed, but fails while actually running the
Live system, this is probably a bug in Debian Live and you are welcome to report
it to us.</para>

<section>
<title>Where to send the bug report?</title>

<para>Report error logs of build time errors to live-helper and run time errors to
live-initramfs in the Debian Bug Tracking System. If you are unsure or need more
help before submitting a bug report, you can always send a message to
<debian-devel-live@lists.alioth.debian.org>. We will help you to figure it out.</para>

<para>To make the most out of your bug report, we require at least the following
information:</para>

<ul><li>Architecture of the host system</li>
<li>Version of live-helper on the host system</li>
<li>Version of live-initramfs on the live system</li>
<li>Version of debootstrap and/or cdebootstrap on the host system</li></ul>

<ul><li>Architecture of the live system</li>
<li>Distribution of the live system</li>
<li>Version of the kernel on the live system</li></ul>

<para>Additionally, to rule out other errors, it is always a good idea to tar up
your config directory and upload it somewhere (do *not* send it as an attachment
to the mailinglist), so that we can try to reproduce the errors you
encountered.</para>
