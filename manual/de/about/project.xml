      <title>What is wrong with current live systems</title>
      <para> When Debian Live was initiated, there were already several Debian based live
systems available and they are doing a great job. From the Debian
perspective most of them have one or more of the following disadvantages: </para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para> They are unofficial projects, developed outside of Debian. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> They mix different distributions, e.g. testing and unstable. </para>

        <listitem>
          <para> They support i386 only. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> They modify the behaviour and/or appearance of packages by stripping them
down to save space. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> They include unofficial packages. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> They ship custom kernels with additional patches that are not part of
Debian. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> They are large and slow due to their sheer size and thus not suitable for
rescue issues. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> They are not available in different flavours, e.g. CDs, DVDs, USB-stick and
netboot images. </para>

      <title>Why create our own live system?</title>
      <para> Debian is the Universal Operating System: Debian has an official live system
for showing around and to officially represent the true, one and only Debian
system with the following main advantages: </para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para> It would be an official Debian subproject. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> It reflects the (current) state of one distribution. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> It runs on as many architectures as possible. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> It consists of unchanged Debian packages only. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> It does not contain any unofficial packages. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> It uses an unaltered Debian kernel with no additional patches. </para>

      <title>Only unchanged, official packages</title>
      <para> We will only use official packages from the Debian repository in the "main"
section. The non-free section is not part of Debian and therefore cannot be
used at all for official live system images. </para>
      <para> We will not change any packages. Whenever we need to change something, we
will do that in coordination with its package maintainer in Debian. </para>
      <para> As an exception, our own packages such as <filename>live-helper</filename>,
<filename>live-boot</filename> or <filename>live-config</filename> may
temporarily be used from our own repository for development reasons (e.g. to
create development snapshots). They will be uploaded to Debian on a regular
basis. </para>
    </sect3>
    <sect3>
      <title>No package configuration of the live system</title>
      <para> In this phase we will not ship or install sample or alternative
configurations. All packages are used in their default configuration as they
are after a regular installation of Debian. </para>
      <para> Whenever we need a different default configuration, we will do that in
coordination with its package maintainer in Debian. </para>
      <para> A system for configuring packages is provided using debconf in <command>lh
config</command> (use --preseed FILE) allowing custom configured packages to
be installed in your custom produced Debian Live images, but for official
live images only default configuration will be used. For more information,
please see <xref linkend="customization"/>. </para>
      <para> Exception: There are a few essential changes needed to bring a live system
to life (e.g. configuring pam to allow empty passwords). These essential
changes have to be kept as minimal as possible and should be merged within
the Debian repository if possible. </para>
